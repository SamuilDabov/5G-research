# 5G-research

# Overview
A **5G Network** should be able to:

1. Have cross-environment approach
2. Support Legacy Systems to regards to radio-new-radio.
3. Perform authentication, set QoS, apply policy and charging rules.
4. Have clear cloud source.
5. Reduce latency for transmission of data based on the Edge Computing to facilitate sensor interactions.

> Back-end engine is improved by not-device use.

6. Base on geo-location boarders can be bound and expanded from MMOs participation.
7. Inner-communication systems such as Bluetooth can transmit self communication to reduce overall density for self-driving cars and AI robots.

>  In US for example current Tesla Autopilot is classified as Level 2 under SAE International six levels (0 to 5) of vehicle automation. As for AI robots:  China AI Development Report 2018 correspond to stunning progress and in US one of known names is Boston Dynamics. Both have improvements into Logistics and others.

# Transmitting infrastructure
Simplified before transmitting: 

* Per wave regulations a government owns the transmitting space generally referred as Air-Interface and Spectrum. A government approves this Spectrum based on regulations. In UK for example, such Spectrum was release to cover the new technologies such as 5G.   
* MNOs stand on 3GPP outlined standards and agreement to achieve what is referred as *roaming*. 
* The **Critical infrastructure** (referred to emergency services, electricity, water supply, etc.) is observed by a governments world wide.
